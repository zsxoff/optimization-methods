# Optimization methods

Some well-known optimization methods written for training or experiment. The purpose of writing methods was to implement algorithms without using ready-made solutions, such as the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) package.

Most likely, these solutions are not applicable in real algorithms and are used solely for demonstration.

Most algorithms use the [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) package for symbolic computing and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting results.
